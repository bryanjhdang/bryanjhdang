## Hi, I'm Bryan ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science student at SFU, and a fledgling software developer that likes making cool stuff. I'm into all sorts of RPG / TTRPGs, video games, and constantly looking for fun things to work on! 

Feel free to check out my personal website here to check out what I'm up to.
